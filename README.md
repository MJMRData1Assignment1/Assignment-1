Introduction
This is a sweetened version of puttanesca – the famous pasta sauce from Naples ‘in the style of the prostitute’ – minus the anchovies, plus chickpeas and spices. It’s quick and super practical to make because the pasta actually cooks in the sauce. Try it, and you may not feel the need to boil pasta ever again.
Ingredients
50ml	olive oil, plus 2 tbsp to serve
6	garlic cloves, crushed
1 x 400g tin of	chickpeas, drained well and patted dry (240g)
2 tsp	hot smoked paprika
2 tsp	ground cumin
¾ tbsp	tomato paste
40g	parsley, roughly chopped
2 tsp	lemon zest
3 tbsp	baby capers
125g	Nocellara olives (or another green olive), pitted and roughly chopped in half (80g)
250g	small, sweet cherry tomatoes
2 tsp	caster sugar
½ tbsp	caraway seeds, lightly toasted and crushed
250g	dried orecchiette
500ml	vegetable or chicken stock
salt and black pepper
Method
1. Put the first six ingredients and . teaspoon of salt into a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, and place on a medium-high heat. Fry for 12 minutes, stirring every now and then, until the chickpeas are slightly crisp – you may need to turn the heat down a little if they start to colour too much. Remove one-third of the chickpeas and set aside to use as a garnish.

2. In a small bowl, combine the parsley, lemon zest, capers and olives. Add two-thirds of the parsley mixture to the saut. pan, along with the cherry tomatoes, sugar and caraway seeds, and cook for 2 minutes on a medium high heat, stirring often. Add the pasta, stock, ¾ teaspoon of salt and 200ml of water, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, cover with the lid and cook for 12–14 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente.

3. Stir in the remaining parsley mixture, drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and garnish with the fried chickpeas and a good grind of pepper.
