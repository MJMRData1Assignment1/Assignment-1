This change is a first step in refactoring ``spaghetti`` that is expected to result in dramatically reduced runtimes for network instantiation and operations. Users currently requiring network and point pattern input as ``libpysal.cg`` geometries should prepare for this simply by converting to ``shapely`` geometries.\n",
